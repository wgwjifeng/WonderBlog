F.A.Q.s

How do I change the header image?
 To change the header image simply replace the fabricflower.png file in the images folder. For best results, use an image that is 100 pixels by 100 pixels.

How do I install this on my WordPress.com account?
This theme is only available for WordPress.org or self hosted websites. There are no plans to make this theme available on WordPress.com.

Can I use Woocommerce with this theme?
This theme doesn't interfere with woocommerce. However, I did not spend time designing to match woocommerce templates with this theme. The default templates for woocommerce will show when activated.

Can I use buddypress/bbpress with this theme?
Just like with woocommerce, this theme does not have any compatibility issues. That being said it also doesn't address the plugins and will use the plugin's default template files.
